### Key Functions

```solidity
// Create a new savings pool
createPool(string name, uint256 target, uint256 contribution, uint256 days)

contribute(uint256 poolId) payable

// Withdraw from completed pool
withdraw(uint256 poolId)

// Get pool details
getPool(uint256 poolId)
```

5. **Get AI Help** - Chat with AI assistant for financial guidance
6. **Withdraw** - Automatically receive funds when pool completes

### For Developers

```typescript
// Example: Read pool data
const { data: pool } = useReadContract({
  address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  abi: SAVINGS_POOL_ABI,
  functionName: 'getPool',
  args: [poolId],
});

// Example: Contribute to pool
const { writeContract } = useWriteContract();
writeContract({
  address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  abi: SAVINGS_POOL_ABI,
  functionName: 'contribute',
  args: [poolId],
  value: contributionAmount,
});
```
